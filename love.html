			<p> <br>We were friends. They made me hummus when I was ill and I helped them with finding a house. We would meet for chai, talk about being queer and about art. I still didn’t know that I was gay. 
				We went out one night for a gig to watch our friends play. The next morning I woke up next to them and I knew this was special. They left and we were meant to get on with work but I couldn’t. I couldn’t get myself to think of anything, I couldn’t eat or sleep or even sit still.
				They came back that night and we spent the next two days together. They felt like a wave.
				Right after, I left for Goa. Over the next couple of days in Goa, I reached the realisation that I am gay. This changed my life emotionally, physically, sexually, and in many ways. It felt like a tsunami. They came to see me through this time. 
				We started to fall in love, quick and easy. 
				I just got myself a house in Goa. 
				It has been 7 months and 2 days today.
				We are in love and we are making this work together…

				<h1> and another

				<p><br>We met at a queer event. She caught my attention - her voice, her words, her presence. I invited her for to join me for another queer event. Soon we got close. She was loving and kind and quite forward in her views and I loved that. 
					We got into a relationship even though we were trying to take things slow.
					We spent a lot of time together and enjoyed riding around town. I loved her. I tried very hard to engage with her sexually but I was not able to in the way that I would have liked to. 
					She even nursed me back to health after a surgery. We tried to make it work but couldn’t and after 6 months we broke up. Covid hit and we were worried for each other. We stayed in each other's lives but I had fallen out of love even when she hadn’t. I believe we weren't compatible. She says her mind knows this but her heart doesn't agree. I miss her and still love her. We will be good friends someday.

  				<p> <br>
					After my partner moved to Canada, I got on Hinge. I met this boy. After a couple of dates, we ended up doing errands together and that was how our relationship grew. He was caring, thoughtful and a gentle human. We spent 6 months together. 
					I could only have drunk sex and he could only have sober sex. We were a mismatch even though we loved each other. I see him every now and then and I know I will always have him in my life.

					I was 29. She was in the country briefly. We were introduced by a mutual friend. Both of us were looking for a flatmate and so we decided to find a place together. During the house hunting process, we began to fall for each other. In Jan 2016, we moved into a new place. 
					She is my heart, my Jaan. We lived together for 3 years after which she moved to Canada. I found it hard to engage sexually unless I was drinking. I haven't seen her in 2 years and 10 months. We still love each other and miss each other dearly. I can’t wait for her to get back to India so we can live happily ever after.

				<br>
				I was 29. I was in a 6 year relationship with a man when I met her online. I fell madly in love with her but didn’t realise that I was gay. She helped me get out of a toxic relationship. We shared a deep connection which also helped us grow creatively. We started working together. She made the music and I danced. We travelled the world. I was trying to explore sexually but couldn’t and believed I was asexual. <br>
				I loved her more than I knew I could love. She told me she had multiple personalities. I met them all. Some of them didn’t like me and some tolerated me, but she told me she loved me and I trusted her. <br>
				After 2 years of performing, working together and loving her, one day, she slipped up. I realised that she had lied to me all along. She had no other personalities and she made it all up to play a game with me. She told me that I was the perfect target. I still don’t understand why someone could do something like this. The only reason I can think of is that she is sick. It was hard to stop loving her.

				I used to dance and sing. He was in my band. We began to understand each other in ways that no one else did. Soon we started seeing each other.
				I loved him. He was confident and talented and we both had the same goals in life. Eventually we started living and working together. Over time something started to change. One day, 2 years into the relationship, I suddenly realised that I was completely isolated. I had no friends of my own and had distanced from my family, I was living and working with him. I had nowhere to go and no one to turn to.
				I didn’t want to have sex with him but I had to. I believed I was asexual.
				Slowly over time, I had lost all my self confidence and my sense of self. I still loved him and couldn’t imagine a future without him. It took me a long time to realise that I would be better off without this relationship but I also didn’t know how to get out of it. 
				During this time I cheated on him with other women but never got caught.
				A couple of years after wanting to leave, I met this girl online and fell madly in love with her. It was unexplainable. It helped me end things with him. I have no love for him.

				<br>
				I was 19. We were classmates in college and he was a loving boy. We were in different cities but we ended up meeting every now and then. I loved him so much, I used to write down every sms he had sent me. 
				A year after being in a long distance relationship, he ran away from home and joined me in Bangalore. We started living together. We were young and reckless. It was a lot of fun. We took long road trips to Goa and stayed for days on end. 
				He continuously cheated on me. I didn’t want to have sex with him but I had to. I thought I was broken, that something was wrong with me.
				5 years after we were together, I met someone else who understood me and we ended our relationship.

				I was 13. My best friend had left the city and I was alone and sad. I met him during this time. He was handsome and a rebel which got me very attracted to him. We were soon in a relationship against everybody’s wishes. 
				He was 3 years older to me and over the course of a year he started to become extremely possessive and insecure. Over the period of 5 years that we were together, he was physically, emotionally and sexually abusive. I loved him and didn’t know better. 
				I tried to run away from home with him a few times.
				I drifted away from my family and friends and he was the only one in my life.
				When I turned 17 my mother decided to take us and leave the city. It was because of this distance that we slowly grew apart. We didn’t have cell phones or money to travel and keep in touch with each other. When I turned 18, I called him up and broke up with him. I still loved him.

				I was 10 and moved into a new school. I quickly became best friends with my classmate. We spent every minute together from early morning to late in the night. I knew I was gay and I was in love with her but didn’t know if it was ok to be that way. She was my first true love. 
				We played sports together, danced and sang, ate meals and did every single thing in each other's company.
				When we turned 12, her parents shifted out of the city and she left. I was truly heartbroken. I decided something was wrong with me for loving her so much and that I needed to change. I felt it was wrong to love her in the way that I did. I changed.
